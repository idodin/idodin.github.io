This roast comes from the Yunnan province of China. It has a really nice and sweet, nutty taste. I found that I got the best results with a simple Drip Coffee (I use a Hario V60). It is raosted by the local Rabbit Hole Roasters.

In Montreal, you can buy this grind from <a href="https://cafemyriade.com/collections/rabbit-hole-roasters/products/lafu-china" target="_blank">Cafe Myriade</a>!

**Notes:** Almond - Butter - Citrus

<h2 id="lafu-story">The Story</h2>
> Yunnan, our core region here at Rabbit Hole Roasters.<br/><br/>We feel it’s important to support new terroir and emerging origins. Coffees from China were a total discovery for us last year, and we are truly happy to work closely with Yunnan Coffee Traders. We are already planning some very interesting projects for the next upcoming harvest.<br/><br/>We were pleasantly surprised by the intense sweetness and complexity of those coffees. It’s only their second or third quality harvest, so it’ll keep improving quickly in the coming years.<br/><br/>We are thrilled to be a part of this journey from almost the beginning, and we committed to partner with them for years to come - something a lot of roasters don’t do. It’s important to do so to provide as much stability as possible to our menu, but more importantly for the producers who now know we are committed to them for a certain quantity, every year!<br/><br/>This lot is the third picking, meaning later in the harvest season. Since coffee is picked when cherries are bright red, multiple picking need to happen to have the highest quality.<br/><br/>This lot is heavy in nuts, chocolate, and sweetness, and offers a syrupy mouthfeel.

<h2 id="lafu-brew">The Brew</h2>

<h4 id="lafu-rinse">The Rinse</h4>
Always rinse these filters with hot water to get rid of the paper taste and heat up your filter / cup.<br/> <br/>

<h4 id="lafu-shake">The Shake</h4>

<h4 id="lafu-pour">The Pour</h4>
Heat water to 93&deg;C - if you're cheap like me and don't have a kettle with adjustable temperatures, this is what you get if you leave boiling water to cool for 30s-45s. Pour 370 grams (millilitres) of water alternating between making swirls from the center outwards and then from the rims inwards, don't allow the water to rise that much higher than the grinds.<br/>
