This roast is a super exciting one which is pretty rare! It comes from Yemen, and has really amazing notes - I remember my father telling me how, growing up, my grandfather would bring back coffee beans from Yemen when he would come home from work, and how delicious they were. It's pretty clear to me that my father was telling the truth, based on this roast. 

In Montreal, you can buy this grind from <a href="https://cafemyriade.com/collections/rabbit-hole-roasters/products/saleh-mohammed-hanash-yemen" target="_blank">Cafe Myriade</a>! For every purchase of this bag, 3$ is donated to Red Cross' Yemeni Appeal! It's super rare, so try to jump on it quick!

**Notes:** Mulberry - Dried Raspberry - Hibiscus - Cardamom - Honey

<h2 id="saleh-story">The Story</h2>
> We are happy to launch one of the World’s rarest coffee, and even happier to do so with a purpose beyond its uniqueness and deliciousness. <br/> <br/>Yemen is engulfed in the worst humanitarian crisis on Earth. 24 million people are in need of aid, including at least 20 million without enough food. More then 3.5 million people had to flee their home.<br/> <br/>For every bag sold, we will donate $3 to Red Cross’s Yemeni Appeal. You could enjoy rare, unique, and delicious coffee while contributing to something great.<br/> <br/>This project is important to us. We are constantly trying to build long term, meaningful relationship with our export partners who are working directly with farmers.

<h2 id="saleh-brew">The Brew</h2>

I found that the nicest brew for this roast was using Tim Wendelboe's Recipe for a classic Dark Cofee. I follow it to a tee and it turns out amazingly!

* **Weight:** 14g
* **Grind Size:** Filter (Finer)
* **Water Temperature:** 96&deg;C
* **First Stir:** 3 times
* **Pour:** 200 grams
* **Steep:** 60 seconds
* **Second Stir:** 3 times
* **Plunge:** 60 seconds

<h4 id="saleh-grind">The Grind</h4>
Grind 14g of Coffee with a Filter Grind (a little bit finer than what you would typically use)- here is a photo for your reference: <br/>

<h4 id="saleh-rinse">The Rinse</h4>
You can rinse your filter to get rid of any paper taste - however, aeropress filters contain less paper than something like a Pour Over, so, this might not be as important. I do it anyways: <br/> <br/>

<h4 id="saleh-shake">The Shake</h4>
Pour grounds into the aeropress and shake to settle. <br/> <br/>

<h4 id="saleh-stir">The Stir</h4>
Heat water to 96&deg;C and pour in with the grinds. Stir strictly 3 times.

<h4 id="saleh-pour">The Steep</h4>
<b>Important:</b> put in the plunger to stop the coffee from dripping. The trick to this is to put the plunger in tilted and then straightening it as below. If your coffee is nonetheless dripping, your grind size is too coarse. Let it steep for 60 seconds.<br/>

<h4 id="saleh-stir-again">The Stir (Again)</h4>
Remove the plunger and stir again, strictly 3 times so as to not under or over extract the coffee!<br/>

<h4 id="saleh-plunge">The Plunge</h4>
Gently push down on the plunger, this should take you around 60 seconds!<br/>
