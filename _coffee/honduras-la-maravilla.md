Honduras La Maravilla is a coffee that comes from its namesake, Honduras. It is roasted by 49th Parallel and has some really interesting notes, I found that brewing it with an Inverted Aeropress method gave me a really nice taste from this roast!

In Montreal, you can buy this grind from <a href="https://cafemyriade.com/collections/49th-parallel-coffee-roasters/products/honduras-la-maravilla" target="_blank">Cafe Myriade</a>!

**Notes:** Root Beer - Citrus - Pear

<h2 id="honduras-story">The Story</h2>
> Each year, when visiting Juan Evangelista, he proudly takes us to his nursery. “More Pacamara!” he proudly exclaims. With every good story, there’s a twist. Juan’s variety is not Pacamara, but instead, Parainema - a hybrid variety that is resistant to rust and nematode infestation. This variety began in 1981 as part of a series of experiments to address producers' issues with diseases and pests and was known as Sarchimor T-5269. First plantings were in Costa Rica from 2006 - 2008, and it was introduced to Honduras in 2010 as “Parainema.” <br/><br/> Juan’s seeds came from his neighbour Eulogio. When Eulogio originally received the seeds, they were listed as Pacamara, but now we believe that was a typo since the physical markers of the plants identified as Parainema.

<h2 id="honduras-brew">The Brew</h2>

I brew using the World Aeropress Champion (yes, that's a thing :joy:) 2016 technique by Filip Kucharczyk. 

* **Weight:** 35g
* **Grind Size:** Coarse
* **Water Temperature:** 85&deg;C
* **Pour:** 150 grams over 15s
* **Stir:** 20 seconds
* **Steep Time:** 60 seconds
* **Plung Time:** 60 seconds

<h4 id="honduras-grind">The Grind</h4>
Grind 35g of Coffee Coarsely - here is a photo for your reference: <br/>

<h4 id="honduras-rinse">The Rinse</h4>
You can rinse your filter to get rid of any paper taste - however, aeropress filters contain less paper than something like a Pour Over, so, this might not be as important. I do it anyways: <br/> <br/>

<h4 id="honduras-pour">The Pour</h4>
Heat water to 85&deg;C - if you're cheap like me and don't have a kettle with adjustable temperatures, this is what you get if you leave boiling water to cool for 45s-60s. Pour in your ground coffee and shake the aeropress to setle the grounds. Pour around 150 grams (millilitres) over 15 seconds into your aeropress:<br/>

<h4 id="honduras-stir">The Stir</h4>
Stir gently over 20 seconds - I use my Aeropress paddle but Filip uses chopsticks to do this (I found no taste difference between the two however).<br/>

<h4 id="honduras-plunge">The Plunge</h4>
Invert the aeropress onto your cup and gently push down (plunge) the plunger - it should take around 60 seconds, but it takes some time to know how hard to push to get that desired time. I spilled a little bit - it's hard to do with one hand while filming :sweat_smile:!<br/>
