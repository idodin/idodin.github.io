              <h3>Biography</h3>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px !important;">
                :wave: Hey there! My name is Imad, I'm a Palestinian-Canadian student
                going into my last semester of Software Engineering at McGill
                University. I've kept myself busy during my time here and met so
                many great people! As I prepare to embark on this next chapter of
                my life, I hope this website can act as a brief summary of what
                I've done with my time (professionally and not) so far!
              </p>
              <p>
                :computer: I decided to commit to a career in tech to help empower others and
                hope that, in the future, I achieve just that goal. The particular
                fields which I'm interested in are Backend and Infrastructure
                Development, I am also extremely passionate about Model-Driven
                Engineering, Software Language Engineering and Distributed Systems
                / Cloud.
              </p>
              <p>
                :heart_eyes: I am most passionate about my extracurricular involvement
                (including social work), experience as a teaching assistant and
                personal projects so please check those out!
              </p>

                :earth_americas: Prior to my time at McGill University, I lived in Geneva,
                Switzerland, New York City, and Halifax, Nova Scotia. While in
                Switzerland I spent much of my time helping acclimate Syrian
                refugees to life in Europe (tutoring children in
                Maths/Physics/Chemistry, translating and even helping some set up
                online businesses).</p> 
              <p>:video_game: I was also a

                and organizer of the first ever Swiss National Tournament on the
                popular rhythm game, osu!. Sadly, my rank has decayed quite a bit and I don't play much
                anymore, but sometimes I log in to catch up with friends!

            <p><b>What is Competitive Programming?</b></p>
            <p>
              Traditionally, Competitive Programming can be descrbed as a mind
              sport where in participants attempt to program a solution to a
              problem with provided specifications, but I much prefer to describe
              it as <b>Leetcode on Crack</b> - i.e. solving similar types of
              problems as LeetCode but with a lot more (complex) algorithms and

              A special shoutout goes to Andre Kaba for starting Competitive
              Programming efforts at McGill. Andre started the club by giving
              random workshops by himself around campus - his love for Competitive
              Programming inspired my and this massive club would not be possible
              without him.

              It's experiences like the one I had at Compete McGill which keep me
              passionate about tech. Being reminded that this field surrounds me
              with extremely friendly, bright and goofy people which I can call my
              friends is one of the things I am extremely thankful for in my life!

              I am one of few undergraduate students to assist in the offering of
              courses in the ECSE department, namely ECSE 223: Model Based
              Programming and ECSE 321: Introduction to Software Engineering. I
              have mentored, graded and developed for 5 course offerings,
              comprising over 100 applications and 400 students.

                  <h4>ECSE 321: Introduction to Software Engineering</h4>
                  <p>
                    The two main objectives of this course are to teach students how to develop
                    a real Full Stack Application with relevant technologies, and
                    help them improve their design thinking (through modelling)!

                  <p>
                    When I took the course, Our project took Second Place in the class and I was
                    subsequently invited to help in offering the course ever
                    since. I have, to date, graded
                    <b>over 60 Web Applications</b> on design, functionality and
                    development practices and am proud to have been involved in
                    the improvement of the course to use more modern technologies.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I am extremely proud of my efforts as part of the course team,
                    as I see students grow and lots of them leveraging their
                    projects to help them get their first internships!

                    This course comprised two things I love profoundly: Modelling
                    (the Software one, not the fashion one!) and Web Development.
                    It is where my passion for Backend and Infrastructure
                    development started and I am really grateful to have been
                    afforded the opportunity to be involved in its offering

                    This course
                    aims to introduce students the concept of modelling (something
                    I love!) as well as have them develop their first Java
                    application (a board game, since Fall 2018).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the 2019-2020 academic year, I was invited to also assist
                    in the offering of this course due to my efforts in
                    Model-Based Software Engineering. I mentored and graded over
                    40 groups and their applications, providing support and
                    evaluating them on design, development practices and teamwork.

                    Since this is the first time many students are able to use
                    what they learn to build a real product, I am lucky to see the
                    glee in lots of students when they are finally finished with
                    their work! I've loved every minute of mentoring teams and
                    often spent time outside of my office hours to make sure that
                    all of them ended the course with something they could be
                    proud of!

                    I oversaw the development of various platforms for McGill Tech
                    Games, an event I hosted as President of Competitive
                    Programming at McGill.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This experience was pretty interesting for me as, although I
                    developed and put some effort into deployment, it was the
                    first time I acted as a Project Manager for a product.

                    The work we did for this event is split across multiple
                    repositories which you can find below (please note that
                    repositories are not refined as we were in quite a rush to

                    Treeple is my first ever Web Project, it was developed as part of the ECSE 321 course at McGill University. It won Second Place out of over 20 groups during the semester and I was subsequently offered to join the teaching staff for the course because of how much I seemingly loved the course material, as well as working with and guiding my teammates!

                    Treeple is a system to manage trees and view sustainability information in the Greater Montreal Area. It has a monolithic Spring Boot Backend, a VueJS frontend and an Android Frontend!

                    I develop and help maintain Canary, the chat bot for McGill
                    University's student run discord server, serving over 1000
                    members.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Canary provides members with the ability to search course
                    databases, exam schedules and other academic information
                    directly from chat, notifies members about weather and food
                    recall warnings and allows members to save quotes by eachother
                    to share later.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Canary also provides moderators with various utilities to
                    moderate the chat: setting user roles and banning / silencing
                    users.

                    I am an active member of the Discord server and was previously
                    a moderator, using Canary (which we have dubbed Marty, for our
                    adorable mascot) almost daily! Feel free to

                    I built a blog for the Summer Training I held for Competitive Programming
                    at McGill in the Summer of 2019. It is very simple blog built with Jekyll
                    - which I highly suggest if you're looking to build a simple blog. (The blog you're reading this on is built with Jekyll!)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Content Management is fairly straightforward with Jekyll, you just need to add a Markdown file to the appropriate folder 
                    on the repository. Hosting is also fairly simple as GitHub Pages has native support for hosting Jekyll source files! (Feel free to see
                    how I set up domains on the repository below!)

                    As you can probably tell by the lengthy, descriptive title,
                    this is a research project that I completed as part of my
                    Capstone project. The objective of this project was to
                    leverage the VIATRA Model Generator to improve the automation
                    of tests for Systems Engineering tools.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This project was a really great experience since I really love
                    modelling and I had a chance to play around with models of a
                    whole bunch of different languages as part of the project. We
                    demonstrated, as a proof of concept, the use of the VIATRA
                    Model Generator to help automate testing on Yakindu Statechart
                    Tools.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While I often hear complaints about how finnicky research is,
                    and I got a taste of this during this project, I actually
                    enjoyed that part of the process quite a bit - as it made the
                    end-product quite a bit more enjoyable for me.

                  <p>
                    This was my project as a 2018 SURE Intern at McGill University. 
                    I was selected as a Cloud and IoT Research Intern based on my 
                    academic performance and worked on developing a Proof of Concept
                    Edge Computing station within the context of IoT Smart Cities. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As part of this project, I developed my own WebRTC Implementation to 
                    develop a Emergency Response Touch Kiosk, establishing connections between 
                    the Kiosk and emergency personnel (e.g. police, paramedics etc.)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I implemented basic facial detection, and retrieved data from various IoT Sensors 
                    performing pre-processing and filtering before forwarding data to Cloud Services for 
                    further computation. I also demonstrated developed various example hooks that could be 
                    abstracted for use by any IoT Device.

                    I developed various simple Arduino devices to simulate IoT Devices in a Smart City - below is

                    As part of a Release Engineering course, I improved the
                    Release pipeline for Skrape.It, an open-source package that
                    facilitates web-scraping on Kotlin. As part of this,

                  <p>
                    I experimented with migrating the project build from Maven to
                    Gradle, to see the effects on build-time. I similarly
                    experimented with migrating CI from Travis to GitHub to see
                    whether there was a noticeable impact on the time to release.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We found that Gradle did not have a significant impact on
                    build time for this project, but demonstrated the importance
                    of caching relevant build files in a release pipeline. We also
                    interestingly note a significant decrease in time-to-release
                    with GitHub Actions vs Travis CI

                    This is a CLI I built for the final project for our course on 
                    Fault Tolerant Computing. It is a Python CLI that takes, as input,
                    a list of network nodes and connections with various costs / reliabilities
                    and outputs the optimal connected network design.

                    This project was not necessarily the most difficutl I've had to do 
                    at my time at McGill, but I thoroughly enjoyed the course on Fault 
                    Tolerance and wanted to include it here!

              I often get asked why I'm part of the
              <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ssamcgillu/"
                >Syrian Students' Association</a
              >
              as someone who is not Syrian. The answer to this is multi-faceted:
              the primary reason is that SSA's work is primarily humanitarian,
              fundraising money and providing events to support to Syrian
              community in Montreal and abroad. This was pretty in line with
              previous efforts I made in high school, which I talk more about
              <a href="#volunteer-diana">below</a>. The Syrian situation is also simply close to my
              heart as a Palestinian, but also due to my mother, who studied in
              Syria and whose parents found refuge in Syria for a time after their
              expulsion from their homes in 1948.

                    In the 2018-2019 academic year, I acted as VP Finance for SSA.
                    I managed around 5000 dollars in funds to organize fundraising
                    and cultural events to preserve the Syrian Identity. Here's a
                    selection of our events:

                    In the 2018-2019 academic year, I acted as VP Media for SSA. I
                    made quite a few graphics that you can find on my Portfoliobox
                    page. I'm not the greatest graphic designer, but it was a
                    position that we could not find anyone else to fill, so I was
                    more than happy to step in. We did several events during the
                    2018-2019 Academic Year including:

            <h2>2017-2018</h2>
            <p>
              In my second year at McGill, I helped with the campagign for the McGill Chapter of Books Not Bombs. 
              I helped organize a campaign to establish a scholarship at McGill University for students displaced by the 
              conflict in Syria. I did some of the following things:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Created campaign graphics for our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BNBMcGill">Facebook Page</a> and Promotional material.</li>
              <li>Helped organize campaigning efforts (Organizing listserv, campus tabling etc.)</li>
              <li>Helped present a motion in support of our scholarship to the Students Society of McGill University General Assembly - All Yays, One Abstained. </li>
            </ul>
            <h1 id="volunteer-badil">Badil Center for Palestinian Human Rights</h1>
            <h2>2014</h2>
            <p>
              I spent some time as an intern for the BADIL Resource Center for Palestinian Human Rights when I was in my second year of high school. My 
              tasks were primarily administrative initially, but eventually evolved to include documentation during various events: 
              I was lucky enough to be given the opportunity to attend the Office for the High Commisioner for Human Rights' (OHCHR) 26th Regular Session. 
              I attended various talks at the session and gave commentary on some of the struggles associated with acclimating children with post-traumatic stress, based some of my own efforts volunteering with Syrian refugee children.
            </p>
            <h1 id="volunteer-diana">Princess Diana Award</h1>
            <h2>2013-2016</h2>
            <p>
              Those who knew me when I lived in Switzerland, know that I spent much
              of my free time working with Syrian refugees to the "Suisse-Romande" area. 
              I worked with families to help them acclimate themselves to life in Switzerland.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here are some of my efforts in this regard:
              <ul>
                 <li>Tutored children in Mathematics, Chemistry, Physics and French to get them
                 caught up to speed in returning to school.</li>
                 <li>Acted as an older brother to children, helping them with struggles in school (primarily in dealing with bullying and anxiety, in part based on my own past experiences).</li>
                 <li>Translated between English, Arabic and French, assisting families in communication with 
                 their children's schools, their local communities and in business opportunities.</li>
                 <li>Helped families set up Whatsapp stores to supplement their income by selling (delicious) food, 
                 arts and crafts and services. (Appropriately filing income with local and federal governments).</li>
                 <li>Organized multiple bake sales, food sales, clothing/furniture drives and events to help settle 
                 families into their new environments comfortably</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>My efforts in this regard (and in assisting in my local school community) awarded me with the <a href="https://diana-award.org.uk/">Princess Diana Award</a> for Community Engagement.</p>
